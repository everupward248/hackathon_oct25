# Cayman Islands Lifestyle-Career Mapping Platform

## ðŸŽ¯ Frontend-Only Prototyping Approach

**Our Team's Mission**: Build a beautiful, intuitive Next.js/React frontend prototype with Material UI to help Caymanians map their lifestyle goals to career opportunities.

### Development Approach
- **Frontend-Only Prototype**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Material UI with client-side logic and mock data
- **Design System**: Caribbean-inspired Material UI theme with custom components
- **Mock Data**: Using sample job postings and client-side calculations for demonstration
- **Future Backend**: API integration ready (structure in place for future Flask/PostgreSQL backend)
