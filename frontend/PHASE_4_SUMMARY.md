## Data Generation

### Pathway Algorithm Logic
1. **Start Point**: Current role (optional) or entry level
2. **Target**: Desired job from dataset
3. **Gap Analysis**: Calculate salary difference
4. **Intermediate Steps**: Create stepping stones (~$20k increments)
5. **Job Matching**: Find real jobs from dataset that fit each step
6. **Timeline Estimation**: ~2.5 years per step
7. **Cost Calculation**: Education costs based on required level
8. **Skills Mapping**: Industry-specific skill generation
9. **Financial Projection**: Year-by-year salary/cost simulation

### Example Pathway Generated
**Target**: Senior Financial Analyst (CI$85,000)
**Current**: Entry Level (CI$35,000)
**Gap**: CI$50,000

**Generated Path**:
1. **Financial Analyst** (1-2 years) → CI$55-60k
   - Education: Bachelor's Degree (CI$30,000)
   - Skills: Financial Analysis, Excel, Accounting
2. **Senior Analyst** (2-4 years) → CI$70-80k
   - Education: CFA Certification (CI$3,500)
   - Skills: Advanced Modeling, Risk Management
3. **Target Role** (4-6 years) → CI$80-90k
   - Total Investment: CI$33,500
   - ROI: 150%+
   - Break-even: Year 3

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Mock Data**: Pathway generation uses simplified algorithms
2. **Skills Database**: Skills are generated based on patterns, not real data
3. **Market Data**: Market demand is simulated, not from labor statistics
4. **Education Costs**: Fixed estimates, not institution-specific
5. **No User Input**: Can't customize starting point (always assumes entry-level)

### Future Enhancements (Phase 5+)
1. **User Customization**:
   - Add current role selection
   - Input current salary
   - Select existing skills from checklist
   - Choose preferred timeline (fast-track vs. gradual)

2. **Comparison Features**:
   - Compare multiple pathways side-by-side
   - Alternative routes to same role
   - Cost/benefit analysis between options

3. **Save & Track**:
   - Save favorite pathways
   - Track progress on current pathway
   - Set milestones and reminders
   - Update skills as learned

4. **Enhanced Visualizations**:
   - Interactive pathway graph (drag nodes)
   - Network diagram showing all possible paths
   - Heatmap of skills by demand
   - Geographic visualization of opportunities

5. **Integration with Real Data**:
   - Connect to Cayman Islands labor market API
   - Real-time job postings
   - Actual education provider costs
   - Industry salary surveys

6. **Social Features**:
   - Share pathways with others
   - See popular pathways
   - Connect with people on similar paths
   - Mentorship matching
